### Introduction
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis process, allowing us to summarize the main characteristics of a dataset and uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. This project employs EDA techniques to evaluate Smart TVs and provide recommendations based on specifications.

### Data Source
The data for this analysis was collected from Flipkart, a popular e-commerce platform. The dataset includes various attributes of Smart TVs, such as price, ratings, pixel count, and operating systems.

### Objectives
